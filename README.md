# TimerLoop: Repeatable Timers

Set looping timers to remind yourself of repeatative tasks throughout the day.

_Focusing on work and need to be reminded to check your email or to take a break? Set a loop to checkin every 15 minutes._

_Stressed out and want to remember to take a breath? Set a loop for that and get some calm._

I created this app originally to help me with anxiety. Instead of constantly thinking "I need to check my email. I need to check my email" and building up anxiety over it, I set a loop to remind me to check it so that I can then focus 100% on the current task at hand and get that thought loop out of my head.

You can set multiple timers, each with their own intervals and start and end times.
